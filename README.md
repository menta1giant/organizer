### Diary
This page contains such sections as 
* **Diary**, which allowes you to express your thoughts about the day that's passed
* **Plans**, which encourages you to check yourself against the plans that you've made yesterday, and also sets you up for the right path for tomorrow!
* **Top**, where you can choose up to 3 people to give your personal awards to (if you decide to do so for any non-weird reason)
* **Daily tasks**, where you fill in your progress in your chosen daily tasks.    
    
Navigation between diary pages is possible via arrows in the top-left corner. You could also go directly to a desired page by typing in a link of form `root/2_diary.html?d=YYYYMMDD`

The page has two preconfigured categories: *Basic* and *Checkboxes*. The latter shall include binary-choice tasks.
There are also options to create new tasks and drag existing ones between categories.

Each person's name is clickable and will open their personal page with their bio and some statistics.The user can edit the bio by entering *edit mode*, which is togglable with a **pen icon** :pencil2: in the top-right corner.
## How did this happen?
Since I started being interested in programming in 2015, I wanted to make myself a tool to record my thoughts and provide help in organizing daily activities and exercises such as
work-outs, memory tasks, puzzles, fast typing etc. So I made it. After all the previous installations that are now lost to history, I started working on a carcass of this piece 
in **2019** and in **early 2020** the whole thing was finished. It serves all the functions I wanted it to, and I find it to be very useful in my daily life.
## How do I launch it?
Use `git clone` to get a copy of this repository, then set up a local Apache server. You can see how to do this [here](https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-install-apache-on-windows/) (for Windows).    
Don't forget to change the web page root to the folder you've put project files into.
